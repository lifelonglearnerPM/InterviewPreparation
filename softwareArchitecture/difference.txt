The terms "software architecture," "software design," "low-level design," and "high-level design" are related but refer to different stages and levels of abstraction in the software development process. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each term:

### Software Architecture
**Software architecture** refers to the high-level structure of a software system, defining the main components or modules and their interactions. It involves making fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented. It addresses:
- **System structure:** The major components and their relationships.
- **Behavior:** How the system's components interact and behave collectively.
- **Non-functional requirements:** Performance, scalability, reliability, security, and other quality attributes.

Key activities include:
- **Defining architectural styles and patterns:** e.g., microservices, layered architecture.
- **Component interaction:** Communication protocols and data exchange mechanisms.
- **Technology stack selection:** Choosing platforms, frameworks, and tools.

### Software Design
**Software design** is a more detailed process that follows the architecture and involves creating a blueprint for the actual coding and implementation. It focuses on:
- **Designing individual components and modules:** Specifying their functionality.
- **Defining interfaces:** How components will interact with each other.
- **Creating detailed models:** Using UML diagrams, flowcharts, etc.

Software design is divided into two main categories: high-level design and low-level design.

### High-Level Design (HLD)
**High-level design** bridges the gap between software architecture and low-level design. It provides an overview of the system that is understandable to stakeholders but includes enough detail to guide the development team. Key aspects include:
- **Subsystem decomposition:** Breaking down the architecture into subsystems or modules.
- **Module descriptions:** Describing the purpose and functionality of each module.
- **Data flow and control flow:** How data and control signals flow through the system.
- **Database design:** High-level schema and data storage considerations.

HLD focuses on the system's overall structure and the major components without getting into the fine details of implementation.

### Low-Level Design (LLD)
**Low-level design** delves into the detailed specifics of each module or component identified in the high-level design. It involves:
- **Detailed algorithms and data structures:** Precisely how each component will perform its tasks.
- **Class diagrams and sequence diagrams:** In object-oriented design, these diagrams specify the interactions and relationships at a granular level.
- **Detailed interface specifications:** The exact methods, parameters, and data types used for communication between modules.
- **Internal logic and error handling:** Specific implementations of functionality and how to handle errors.

LLD provides a comprehensive plan that can be directly translated into code by developers.

### Summary
- **Software Architecture:** High-level structure and non-functional requirements of the entire system.
- **High-Level Design:** Overview of subsystems/modules and their interactions based on the architecture.
- **Low-Level Design:** Detailed design of individual components/modules with specific implementation details.
- **Software Design:** Encompasses both high-level and low-level design, providing a complete blueprint for the system's construction. 

Each of these stages plays a critical role in ensuring that the software is well-structured, maintainable, and meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

Let's dive deeper into each of these concepts with examples and diagrams.

### Software Architecture

**Example: E-commerce Platform Architecture**

In this example, we'll use a common architectural style, Microservices Architecture, for an e-commerce platform.

**Diagram:**

**Components:**
- **User Service:** Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
- **Product Service:** Manages product catalog, including product details, pricing, and inventory.
- **Order Service:** Manages customer orders, order processing, and order history.
- **Payment Service:** Handles payment processing, including integration with payment gateways.
- **Notification Service:** Sends notifications to users about order status, promotions, etc.

**Interactions:**
- **API Gateway:** Acts as an entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate services.
- **Service Communication:** Typically through RESTful APIs or messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ).

### High-Level Design (HLD)

**Example: Product Service HLD**

**Diagram:**

*Source: [High-Level Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:High-level_design_diagram_example.png)*

**Components:**
- **Product Controller:** Handles incoming requests related to products.
- **Product Repository:** Manages database interactions for product data.
- **Product Service:** Contains business logic for product management.
- **Database:** Stores product information.

**Data Flow:**
1. **Request:** User sends a request to view a product.
2. **Controller:** Product Controller receives the request.
3. **Service:** Product Service processes the request, applying business logic.
4. **Repository:** Product Repository fetches the product data from the database.
5. **Response:** The processed data is sent back to the user.

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

**Example: Product Service - Get Product Details**

**Class Diagram:**

+------------------+
| ProductService   |
+------------------+

+------------------+
         |
         |
         v
+--------------------+
| ProductRepository  |
+--------------------+
| + findById(id)     |
+--------------------+
         |
         |
         v
+----------------+
| Product Entity |
+----------------+
| - id           |
| - name         |
| - description  |
| - price        |
+----------------+
```

**Sequence Diagram:**
```plaintext
User        ProductController        ProductService        ProductRepository
 |                |                        |                        |
 |  GET /product/{id} ->                   |                        |
 |                |       getProduct(id) ->|                        |
 |                |                        |       findById(id) ->  |
 |                |                        |                        |
 |                |<------- Product -------|<------ Product --------|
 |                |                        |                        |
 |<--- Product ---|                        |                        |
 |                |                        |                        |
```

**Detailed Logic (in pseudocode):**
```plaintext
ProductService {
    Product getProduct(int id) {
        // Fetch product details from the repository
        Product product = productRepository.findById(id);
        // Return the product details
        return product;
    }
}

ProductRepository {
    Product findById(int id) {
        // Query the database for the product
        // SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = id;
        return database.query("SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ?", id);
    }
}
```
